This is a file containing stuff about vim I'd like to remmeber but I am scared that I'll forget

FOLDING
=======
included with plugin vim-markdown

	Folding is enabled for headers by default.

	The following commands are useful to open and close folds:

	    zr: reduces fold level throughout the buffer
	    zR: opens all folds
	    zm: increases fold level throughout the buffer
	    zM: folds everything all the way
	    za: open a fold your cursor is on
	    zA: open a fold your cursor is on recursively
	    zc: close a fold your cursor is on
	    zC: close a fold your cursor is on recursively

	Options are available to disable folding or change folding style.

	Try :help fold-expr and :help fold-commands for details.

Surround
------

look in the included surround.txt in ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-surround-2.2/doc/surround.txt

Commentary
------
and those work as a toggle!

gcc	- comments a line
gc	- comments a motion (e.g. gcip comments paragraph)
gcgc 	- uncoments set of adjecent commented lines
Commentary - you can use this as a command (e.g. for substitutions)

Replace with register
------

[count]["x]gr{motion}   Replace {motion} text with the contents of register x.
                        Especially when using the unnamed register, this is
                        quicker than "_d{motion}P or "_c{motion}<C-R>"
[count]["x]grr          Replace [count] lines with the contents of register x.
                        To replace from the cursor position to the end of the
                        line use ["x]gr$
{Visual}["x]gr          Replace the selection with the contents of register x.
